"Relations between temporal_entities (tt is time-time relation, i.e. relations between two different temporal entities.
for example, ttmod_rel(before, time_period), it looks into semlinks, where semlink(%Something, TIME_PERIOD, via(TPREP(AFTER))), and realizes that 'after' is relating the something to the temporal_entity 'time_period'. The macro either relates that something directly, or checks is that entity has an associated time_point and places that time_point after the time_period."
