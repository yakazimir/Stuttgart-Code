This subdirectory contains the extracted events or meaning representations (MRs) from the original Robocup game files.  Each line in the files are of the following format:

<start time> | <end time> | <event>

The start and end times indicate the duration of the event.  Many events are instantaneous events while some events have a longer duration.  For example, a pass event starts when the passer starts the pass and ends when the receiver gets the pass.  A CFG grammar for parsing the events can be found in mrl-grammar in the main directory.
